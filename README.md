# Bitcoin and Gold Price Prediction and Portfolio Maximization

**This README file aims to give you a brief about what this project is about, for more details you can refer to the presentation slides "Trio_30.pptx"**

This project explores the prediction of Bitcoin and Gold prices using ARIMA and LSTM models and develops tailored trading strategies by leveraging Reinforcement Learning techniques to maximize portfolio profits. The study covers data preprocessing, price prediction modeling, and trading strategy implementation using benchmark and reinforcement learning methods.

## Authors

## Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to:
1. Develop models using the past daily prices of Bitcoin and Gold (from 09/12/2016 to 08/09/2021) to predict the prices for the following month.
2. Create trading strategies to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell assets to maximize profits until 09/10/2021.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Daily prices of Bitcoin and Gold (09/12/2016 to 09/10/2021).
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - **Missing Values:** Filled using the average of the preceding and subsequent day prices.
  - **Weekend Prices:** Forward filled with Friday's prices for Gold.
  - **Train-Test Split:** Data before 08/10/2021 used for training; remaining data for testing.

## Methodology

### 1. Prediction
#### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Key Steps:**
  - Explored the stationarity and seasonality of data.
  - Selected ARIMA models' parameters based on stationarity pattern and ACF and PACF plots.
  - Updated models iteratively with observed prices.
- **Results:**
  - ARIMA(2,1,2) for Gold, ARIMA(1,1,1) for Bitcoin showed good performance.

#### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)
- **Architecture:**
  - 3 LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer.
  - Captures long-term dependencies in time-series data.
- **Results:**
  - Successfully modeled and predicted trends for both assets.

### 2. Trading Strategies
#### Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Learning)
- **Approach:**
  - Utilized a neural network to approximate Q-values and train trading policies based on the Bellman equation.
- **Performance:**
  - For Bitcoin: RL achieved 2% profitability, 17% higher than benchmark strategies.
  - For Gold: RL underperformed due to market stability favoring simpler strategies.

#### Benchmark Strategies
- **Compared Results:**
  - Static strategies performed better for Gold due to price stability.
  - Dynamic RL strategies excelled in Bitcoin trading due to market volatility.

## Conclusion

- **Bitcoin:** RL-based strategies demonstrated superior adaptability and profitability in volatile markets.
- **Gold:** Simpler, static trading strategies performed better due to market stability.
